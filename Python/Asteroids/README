I discussed the exercise with:

README for ex9
includes files for all functions that were mentioned in the instructions

comments:
I added few functions to the existing API:
end_game-checks if there is a car in the exit cell,which means the car should come to an end

In the car calss there are a few functions that return the values of car attribiutes(just like get_name)

The possible moves def in the board calss palys a major role since every movement of the car during in the 
game requires the program to go through all the possible moves and check if the users input is one of these moves.

in the play def,the game checks if the move is possible using the possible moves def.If so,the car will move,otherwise
it will check for different input from the user.The game will end when the end_game function will return true.
