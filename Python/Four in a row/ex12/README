ai.py - contains a class of the ai of the game with the following functions:

find_legal_move - checks for a column with an empty disc and returns it

create a new game with a new parent using inner functions and 
an exit option which closes the game.


class ConnectFour -a class of the moves of the game in the gui
__init__ - first creates new frame and canvas for the game instance
and than the board and buttons with the column number for
the user to press when playing
single_turn - checks if pc vs pc game,if so wont allow to press button
checks if player 1 is ai,if so, makes a move
checks if player 2 is ai,if so, makes a move
