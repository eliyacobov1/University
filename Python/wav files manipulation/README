README for ex6
includes files for all functions that were mentioned in the instructions

comments:
class_wav_file-We created a class in order to assign atributes to the each variable of this type and class 
(for each frame ratein audio data list that we got from an external wav file we created a variable that belong to this class)

def start_menu- The first function which the user interacts with fron this menu,
 depending on the users input the function will activate the next function which
 will allow the user to modify wav files according to his choises.

def get_file- The function gets the wav file directory from  the user as an input
 and if the input has no falts it assigns the files frame rate and audio data list
 into a wav_file type object from the class that we created.

def change file - Allows the user to execute one of six possible predetermand
 actions in order to modify the wav file.

def transition menu - After each action that the user choses to do he will reach
 the transition menu which will allow him to save the data into a wav file or
 continue modifying the wav file.

def combinefiles - combines two wav files first the function gets the files names
 from the user as an input it seperates and assigns the files atributes into two
 differnts wav_file type object. Afterwards the function will creat a new audio data
 into which it will assign values depending on the two audio data lists it gets
 (their length), the frame rates and the GCD of the frame rates.

def compose melody- The functuon reads the instuctions file and creates a new list into
 which it assigns values dependeingon the vocal frequency which we manualy assigned at
 the begining of the file depending on the musical note and also the given period of time
 that each musical note has.
