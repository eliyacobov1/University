Spaceship.java:The main super class that defines the SpaceShip type object.I chose to define 6 instance
variables which are-physics,health,energy,max_energy,shot_timer,shield.All of which helped me implement the 
methods in the API.Each variable is well documented and has a description inside of the java file.Also,I have
added a few methods of my own that I saw fit for the implentation of this exrecise.

Runner.java-implements the runner class which represents the 'runner' type spaceship

Aggressive.java-implements the aggressive class which represents the 'aggressive' type spaceship

Basher.java-implements the basher class which represents the 'basher' type spaceship

Human.java-implements the human class which represents the 'human' type spaceship

Drunkard.java-implements the drunkard class which represents the 'drunkard' type spaceship

Special-implements the special class which represents the 'special' type spaceship

SpaceShipFactory.java-A class which includes one method that converts an array of string's to an array
of SpaceShip type object depends on the characters which were input. 

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================

In order to implement the types of ships as requested,I used the hierarchy principle and implemented 6 subclasses
to the SpaceShip class.In each file I designed the spaceship's attribiutes and methods according to the description 
of it.Almost in every file I implemented a seperate DoAction method alongside other methods like movement,shoot and ctivate shield.
All are meant to dictate the ship behaviour according to its designated characteristics (part of the override principle).

Drunkard:I chose to program the drunkard by giving it random commands for movement,shooting and teleportation (using JAVA's Random)

Special:I chose to make the special ship a combination of behaviours of the aggresive,basher and runner ships.Hence making it 
the "smartest" ship which acts in the most intelegent manner (AI wise).It attacks other ships,while also trying to avoid 
the incoming projectiles and activate its shields when a hostile ship is closing on it.Also,instead of reganerating 1 energy unit per
round, like all the other ship (using the increase_energy method which I implemented),it reganerates 5 energy units to make 
it more effective and distinguishable.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================

As far as extensiblity goes,the code is up to par.I added a bunch of new methods like I mentioned before.
list of these functins:*is_shield_on,*turn_shield_off,*increase_shot_timer,*increase_energy,*movement (**different on each ship type)
,*activate_shields(**),teleport_decider (special_ship method).

Understandibility-The code is devided into files,which in my opinion,makes things more orginized and clear for the user.There
is a detailed explenation almost after every step in the more intricate methods.
