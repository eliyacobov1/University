I discussed the exercise with:
README for ex1

Book.java:Includes all methods that were described in the API.In addition,I added 2 instance variables-
-ID and partonId in order to keep track of the book's id after adding it to a library and of it's owners 
id when a patron is borrowing it.

Patron.java:Includes all methods that were described in the API.I have added 2 instance variables to this class-
-id to keep track of the patron's id when he is registered to a certain library,and NumBooksBorrowed in order to check
if a patron is not exceeding the limit of the maximum books that he can borrow (depending on the value which is defined to that specific library)

Library.java: Includes all methods that were described in the API.Design choices are described in the last part
of this file.

Design:In addition to the variables which I chose to add (the one's that were mentioned above),I added getters and setters
for the book and patron classes,so that I can manage the methods in the library class in a more convinient manner.Also,for the
library class,I have added a patron list,a book list, and two additional variables-book count and patron count.The ID that is 
being set and determined for each  book and patron upon adding a book to the library or registering a patron to the library,is
being orginized i n a subsequent manner and it is done so with the of these variables that i have just mentioned.Each book and patron
will recieve an id number (if eligible to join the library according to the critiria that is further described in the java file itself)
and will be placed in the (id-1) place in the suitible array.That way,it is easy to access each object given the object's ID.
