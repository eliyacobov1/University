Explanation:

constants and macro definitions:
*invalid_msg, *args_msg - string constants that represent the errors
that are handed out in case the program dosen't run as expected (should cover all cases)

Principles:

There is an emphesise on modularity. The code is divided to many diffrent
functions.

*isRational - checks if a given number is legal. If so, checks if its also natural.

*chooseFunc- Iv'e implemented the 6 legal functions seperatly and this function returns
the appropriate function to the input number. Single choise principle plays a part here.

*checkInput - function that asserts that the given input is valid (so tht we know
if there is a need for the program to continue running)

*The integration and derivative function are will consider the return value from a function
NAN to mean that the user input is not part of the function domain, and therefore an invalid
error msg and failure code will be returned is such a case.

*Integration uses a dynimically allocated int array in order to calculate the riemann integral 
in the given range of values. The array memory is freed at the end of this function.
