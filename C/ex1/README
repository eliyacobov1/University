Explanation:

constants and macro definitions:
*MAXINPUT represents the max char capacity in user input line

*ARRAYSIZE, N, M represent the max capacities for the number series g, h

*INPUT_DELIM represnt space delimiters, used to seperate user input values
in the function "seriesinput"

*DOT represnts a dot char. we use it to check if dots are present in a given number

*UNDERFLOW_BOUNDARY used to avoid devision by 0 in certain cases

*MULTIPLY macro function that multiplies two numbers

*CHECK_DIGIT macro function that checks if a given char represents a digit

Principles:

There is a big emphesise on modularity. The code is divided to many diffrent
function:

*strnum- converts number from string fromat to double

*isrational-asserts that a number is rational

*isnatural-asserts that a number is natural (or 0)

*seriesinput- inserts user input to double array (iff input consists of rational nums)

*numinput -returns the number which the user entered (iff it is a natural num or 0)

*center- gets an array of double values relocates the values which were entred by a user
to the center of the array

*norm-normilizes the values of a double array using L1 norm

*convolution- gets two arrays of double volues, and a number (n), and returns an array
of values represnting the convolution result for the 2 arrays after n times.

*histogram-prints histogram of the given array values

Remarks:
*notice that upon an initialization of a double array, I put zeroes as the array
values to avoid potential errors further down the road
